# 3D-FLIPING-BTN

Lesson learnt from the project.

Perspective:
perspective is the most important line of code when designing 3d elements with css

when styling 3d objects in css,we need to tell the browser the perspective in which the user is viewing the page. perspective: 800px; tells the browser the user is 800px away from the screen and will allow them to view edges and conners when viewing the 3d objects. perspective: 0; basically tells the browser there is no distance between the page and the viewer.
